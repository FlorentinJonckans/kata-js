### Node.js & ES6+ Support

The current Node versions [available](https://github.com/Codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Language-JavaScript) are the following [Node.js v6.x](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#node6_5), [Node.js v8.x](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#node8_7) and [Node.js v10.x](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#node10_9)

### Purpose

Practicing katas could help you to improve your algorithmic thinking. It could also help at interviews being more confident and learning a few tricks of your preferred language.
I highly recommend the [Tech Interview Handbook](https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook) which will help you ace your next technical interview.
